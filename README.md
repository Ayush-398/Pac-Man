# Pac-Man with c
This repository houses a C project that leverages the minilibx graphics library to recreate the iconic Pac-Man game. It faithfully reproduces the game's mechanics and introduces distinct AI algorithms for each ghost character, providing an authentic gaming experience. The project is flexible, allowing for the adjustment of ghost numbers on the map to enhance gameplay variety.

Moreover, this repository also includes an 'empty-game' template, designed to serve as a starting point for developers interested in creating their mini-games using the minilibx library. It provides a foundation for building custom games and serves as a mini-game engine for aspiring game developers to explore and expand upon.
